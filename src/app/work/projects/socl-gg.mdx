## Overview

Development of a link-in-bio service that looked and behaved well.

## Technologies Used

- *Frontend*:
  - **Next.js**: For fast, server-rendered React applications.
  - **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application.
  - **[Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)**: For building the UI components.
- *Backend*:
  - **Node.js**: Backend runtime.
  - **TypeScript**: Safer and more reliable programming language, while still being easy to write.
  - **[Fastify](https://fastify.dev/)**: Fast and efficient web framework with a good ecosystem.
  - **PostgreSQL with [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM**: Prisma allows for a better developer experience and is easier to maintain than raw SQL.
- *Payment*:
  - **[Stripe](https://stripe.com/)**: To handle payments and subscriptions for the premium features.
- *Hosting*:
  - **[Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/)**: Affordable and reliable hosting.

## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was to create a scalable and maintainable backend that could handle the growing number of users and features, as the application was hosted and self-managed on a [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) server.

Another challenge was to prevent fake analytics data from being recorded. This was achieved by creating a custom fraud-prevention analytics library that could detect and prevent fake user visits from being recorded. Within this library, it analyzed certain information sent from the user, like the IP address, user agent, and device information, to determine if the user was real or fake, as well as detecting if a user had multiple accounts.
