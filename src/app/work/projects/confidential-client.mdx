## Challenges and Learnings

The main challenge was to engineer and create a library that could be used to login, message, and manage the accounts across multiple platforms.

The second challenge was to create a RBAC[^1] system that could be used to manage the permissions of the members of the client organization.

[^1]: RBAC stands for [Role-Based Access Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control).
